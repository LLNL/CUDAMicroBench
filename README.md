# CUDAMicroBench

Programming to achieve high performance for NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA has been known to be challenging. A GPU has hundreds or thousands of cores that a program
must exhibit sufficient parallelism to achieve maximum GPU utilization. A system with GPU accelerators has a heterogeneous and deep memory system that programmers must effectively and correctly use to fully take advantage of the GPUâ€™s parallelism capability. 

We present CUDAMicroBench, a collection of fourteen microbenchmarks that demonstrate performance challenges in CUDA programming and techniques to optimize
the CUDA programs to address these challenges. It also includes examples and techniques for using advanced CUDA features such as data shuffling between threads, dynamic parallelism, etc that can help users optimize the CUDA program for performance. 

The microbenchmark can be used for evaluating the performance of GPU architectures, the memory systems of GPU itself and of the whole system architectures, and for evaluating the effectiveness of compiler and performance tools for performance analysis. It can be used to help users understand the complexity of heterogeneous GPU-accelerator systems through examples and guide users for performance optimization.

## Features
 1. A collection of fourteen microbenchmarks,
 1. Exhibit performance challenges in CUDA programming,
 1. Exhibit techniques to optimize the CUDA program to address the challenges,
 1. Includes examples and techniques for using advanced CUDA features,
 1. Help users to optimize CUDA program for performance

## Prerequisite
To execute microBenchmark, NVIDIA GPU and CUDA are needed. Some new features such as dynamic parallelism and memcpy_async require the GPU to support CUDA11.
    
## Experiment
There are fourteen examples so far you can experiment. You can check the Makefile in each folder to see how they can be compiled and then excute it by using the .sh file.

## Common folder

Several benchmarks are derived from CUDA Samples, including GSOverlap, ConKernels and Taskgraph. Some header files required by these three benchmarks are stored in the common folder, which also comes from CUDA Samples.
