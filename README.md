# CUDAMicroBench
Microbenchmarks to Assist CUDA Performance Programming
## Features
 1. A collection of fourteen microbenchmarks,
 1. Exhibit performance challenges in CUDA programming,
 1. Exhibit techniques to optimize the CUDA program to address the challenges,
 1. Includes examples and techniques for using advanced CUDA features,
 1. Help users to optimize CUDA program for performance

## Prerequisite
To execute microBenchmark, NVIDIA GPU and CUDA are needed. Some new features such as dynamic parallelism and memcpy_async require the GPU to support CUDA11.
    
## Experiment
There are fourteen examples so far you can experiment. You can check the Makefile in each folder to see how they can be compiled and then excute it by using the .sh file.
